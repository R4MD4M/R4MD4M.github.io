We are a collective of dreamers who want to meet, create and have fun. RAMDAM is the event that brings us together in order to do so. 

Each of us will come with a project. To realize their projects, participants respect some flexible [rules](/rules) designed to balance productivity and fun. A stone will be given to the participants. When worn, participants will be in productivity mode and will work on their projects. When not worn, participants will engage in zinz.

As well as their projects, participants will animate and attend short workshops such as mini seminars, learning sessions, collaborative improvisations, etc ...

Once the camp is set up, you will be able to follow our activities on this website.
